The app uses the [raylib](https://crates.io/crates/raylib) crate. ![Rust_logo](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qxtg8B8EEy8/XgBm0Bp1y4I/AAAAAAAAPD0/LdIgBrYPAMQ8VpGV4EBz6Kq9uBgoo1NmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/rust-logo.png)

You must have [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) installed to run.

Now, it can run on linux and windows. (Only X11 is supportted and require xorg-dev on ubuntu based distros. For RHEL based distros, sudo dnf groupinstall "X Software Development".)
